# 🌳Carbon FootPrint
A carbon footprint refers to the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, organization, event, or product, measuring its impact on the environment and climate change. It's a critical measure for assessing our impact on the environment.

☀️ How much impact do you have on global warming?

Human activities such as transportation, electricity consumption, and industry contribute excessive carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, leading to disruptions. As carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere, increases, the Earth warms, climates change, glaciers melt, and infectious diseases proliferate. Each of us adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through our actions at home, in cars, and at work, accelerating global warming. Measure your carbon footprint and take action! The process of global warming has begun, and reversing it is challenging. However, we can at least prevent further progression. Trees are one of the most powerful methods to reduce the threats of global warming because they absorb greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. By entering your individual or corporate information and pressing the Calculate Carbon Footprint! button below, you can calculate the amount of carbon emissions caused by your consumption and how many trees you owe to nature and make a donation.
